motion controled LED bulb
This project demonstrates an automatic lighting system using a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, 8051 microcontroller, relay, and a bulb. The main goal of this system is to detect human motion using the PIR sensor and automatically control the bulb accordingly.

When a person enters the sensing area, the PIR sensor detects infrared radiation changes and sends a signal to the 8051 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes this signal and activates a relay, which in turn turns ON the bulb. After a certain delay or when no motion is detected, the microcontroller turns OFF the bulb by deactivating the relay.

This project is useful in energy-saving applications like automatic room lighting, corridors, restrooms, and security systems, where lights need to be turned on only when someone is present
